This is the code for the second experiment reported in:
Folke et al (2016) Explicit representation of confidence informs future value-based decisions (Nature Human Behaviour, DOI: 10.1038/s41562-016-0002).
    
The code is written by Tomas Folke in SR Research Experiment Builder Version 1.10.1630. This Experiment can only be run on a system connected to an SR research eye tracker. 

Run the experiment by opening the 3_Opts_Value_Task.exe file in the Task_Code folder. Make sure you keep the folder structure intact or you might encounter an error. The original printed instructions for the task can be found as a pdf in the folder “Instructions”. The images used in the task can be found in Task_Code/library/images.

If you have any questions about the code feel free to contact me on tomas.folke@gmail.com.
